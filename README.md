A high-level wrapper of [PyAV](https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV) providing an easy to use interface to video data.

The goal of this library is to provide a simple interface while maintaining good computational performance. At current, only MP4 and MJPEG videos are officially compatible.

Features include:

- Performant reading of video files (optionally including audio) utilizing multi-threading.
- Ability to arbitrarily index frames by their index or timestamp.
- Ability to slice the video by frame index or time. Large slices will be loaded lazily to avoidexcessive RAM consumption.
- A frame buffer is maintained to cache frames close to the current decoding position, which avoids repetitive seeking when going back and forth between frames in the same neighborhood or iterating backwards.
- Avoids demuxing and seeking operations as much as possible.
- Reading multi-part video files (e.g. how they are generated by Neon or Pupil Invisible).

## Installation

```bash
pip install pupil_labs_video
```
